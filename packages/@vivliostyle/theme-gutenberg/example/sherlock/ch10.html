      <h2>The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor</h2>
      <p>
        The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long
        ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the
        unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their
        more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old
        drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have
        never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock
        Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that
        no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this
        remarkable episode.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was
        still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from
        an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had
        remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to
        rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had
        brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign
        throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my
        legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers
        until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all
        aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
        envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble
        correspondent could be.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your
        morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a
        tide-waiter.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he
        answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.
        This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
        a man either to be bored or to lie.”
      </p>
      <p>He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.</p>
      <p>“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”</p>
      <p>“Not social, then?”</p>
      <p>“No, distinctly professional.”</p>
      <p>“And from a noble client?”</p>
      <p>“One of the highest in England.”</p>
      <p>“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”</p>
      <p>
        “I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client
        is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is
        just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new
        investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have
        you not?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the
        corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read
        nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is
        always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely
        you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”
      </p>
      <p>“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”</p>
      <p>
        “That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.
        Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these
        papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he
        says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:—Lord Backwater tells me that I may place
          implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have
          determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in
          reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection
          with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in
          the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your
          co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some
          assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the afternoon, and, should
          you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will
          postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours
          faithfully,
          <span class="sign">“ ‘ST. SIMON.’</span>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        “It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the
        noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer
        side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the
        epistle.
      </p>
      <p>
        “He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the
        subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order
        of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a
        red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the
        mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out
        upon his knee. “ ‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son
        of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief
        over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is
        mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late
        administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for
        Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and
        Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive
        in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more
        solid.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for the
        facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared
        to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand
        and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.
        That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the
        first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column
        of the <em>Morning Post</em>, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A
        marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct,
        very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of
        the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of
        Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin
        legs towards the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of
        the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection
        in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to
        tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the
        noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair
        cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made
        during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne
        away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
        for over twenty years proof against the little god’s arrows, has now
        definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the
        fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose
        graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the
        Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently
        reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures,
        with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke
        of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few
        years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small
        estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not
        the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy
        and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’ ”
      </p>
      <p>“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.</p>
      <p>
        “Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the
        <em>Morning Post</em>
        to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would
        be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate
        friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the
        furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius
        Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt
        announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon
        would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are
        all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”
      </p>
      <p>“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.</p>
      <p>“The vanishing of the lady.”</p>
      <p>“When did she vanish, then?”</p>
      <p>“At the wedding breakfast.”</p>
      <p>
        “Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
        dramatic, in fact.”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”</p>
      <p>
        “They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the
        honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.
        Pray let me have the details.”
      </p>
      <p>“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”</p>
      <p>“Perhaps we may make them less so.”</p>
      <p>
        “Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning
        paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular
        Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:
      </p>
      <p>
        “ ‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest
        consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place
        in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in
        the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is
        only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which
        have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of
        the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been
        drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard
        what is a common subject for conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        “ ‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,
        was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride,
        Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord
        Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the
        bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded
        afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where
        breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was
        caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured
        to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that
        she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and
        prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The
        bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant
        interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she
        complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her
        prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her,
        but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for
        an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the
        passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the
        house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his
        mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his
        daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the
        bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police,
        and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result
        in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late
        hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts
        of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and
        it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had
        caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or
        some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange
        disappearance of the bride.’ ”
      </p>
      <p>“And is that all?”</p>
      <p>
        “Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a
        suggestive one.”
      </p>
      <p>“And it is—”</p>
      <p>
        “That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has
        actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a
        <em>danseuse</em> at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
        for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is
        in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have
        missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as
        the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this
        will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I
        very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door.
        A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and
        pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the
        steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to
        command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general
        appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward
        stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he
        swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and
        thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
        foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow
        gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced
        slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging
        in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take
        the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a
        little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.
        Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already
        managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that
        they were hardly from the same class of society.”
      </p>
      <p>“No, I am descending.”</p>
      <p>“I beg pardon.”</p>
      <p>“My last client of the sort was a king.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”</p>
      <p>“The King of Scandinavia.”</p>
      <p>“What! Had he lost his wife?”</p>
      <p>
        “You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the affairs
        of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own
        case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in
        forming an opinion.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,
        nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for
        example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an
        opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by
        questioning you.”
      </p>
      <p>“Pray do so.”</p>
      <p>“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”</p>
      <p>“In San Francisco, a year ago.”</p>
      <p>“You were travelling in the States?”</p>
      <p>“Yes.”</p>
      <p>“Did you become engaged then?”</p>
      <p>“No.”</p>
      <p>“But you were on a friendly footing?”</p>
      <p>
        “I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”
      </p>
      <p>“Her father is very rich?”</p>
      <p>“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”</p>
      <p>“And how did he make his money?”</p>
      <p>
        “In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
        invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s
        character?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the
        fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her
        father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp
        and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come
        from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in
        England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any
        sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She
        is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
        resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name
        which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I
        not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is
        capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would
        be repugnant to her.”
      </p>
      <p>“Have you her photograph?”</p>
      <p>
        “I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face
        of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature,
        and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black
        hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long
        and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to
        Lord St. Simon.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
        acquaintance?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her
        several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”
      </p>
      <p>“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”</p>
      <p>“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”</p>
      <p>
        “And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a
        <em>fait accompli</em>?”
      </p>
      <p>“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”</p>
      <p>
        “Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
        wedding?”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes.”</p>
      <p>“Was she in good spirits?”</p>
      <p>
        “Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future
        lives.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”
      </p>
      <p>“And did you observe any change in her then?”</p>
      <p>
        “Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever
        seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was
        too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”
      </p>
      <p>“Pray let us have it, for all that.”</p>
      <p>
        “Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the
        vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into
        the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed
        it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall.
        Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in
        the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this
        trifling cause.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the
        general public were present, then?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”
      </p>
      <p>“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”</p>
      <p>
        “No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
        common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I
        think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful
        frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering
        her father’s house?”
      </p>
      <p>“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”</p>
      <p>“And who is her maid?”</p>
      <p>
        “Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with
        her.”
      </p>
      <p>“A confidential servant?”</p>
      <p>
        “A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to
        take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these
        things in a different way.”
      </p>
      <p>“How long did she speak to this Alice?”</p>
      <p>“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”</p>
      <p>“You did not overhear what they said?”</p>
      <p>
        “Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was
        accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do
        when she finished speaking to her maid?”
      </p>
      <p>“She walked into the breakfast-room.”</p>
      <p>“On your arm?”</p>
      <p>
        “No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,
        after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,
        muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her
        room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and
        went out.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company
        with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already
        made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and
        your relations to her.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have
        been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a
        <em>very</em> friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
        not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint
        against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear
        little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me.
        She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be
        married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage
        celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in
        the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she
        endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions
        towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the
        possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there
        in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when
        she saw that there was no good in making a row.”
      </p>
      <p>“Did your wife hear all this?”</p>
      <p>“No, thank goodness, she did not.”</p>
      <p>“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”</p>
      <p>
        “Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so
        serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some
        terrible trap for her.”
      </p>
      <p>“Well, it is a possible supposition.”</p>
      <p>“You think so, too?”</p>
      <p>
        “I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as
        likely?”
      </p>
      <p>“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”</p>
      <p>
        “Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is
        your own theory as to what took place?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have
        given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it
        has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the
        consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the
        effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”
      </p>
      <p>“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”</p>
      <p>
        “Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not
        say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without
        success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes,
        smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my
        data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that
        you could see out of the window?”
      </p>
      <p>“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”</p>
      <p>
        “Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall
        communicate with you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our client,
        rising.
      </p>
      <p>“I have solved it.”</p>
      <p>“Eh? What was that?”</p>
      <p>“I say that I have solved it.”</p>
      <p>“Where, then, is my wife?”</p>
      <p>“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”</p>
      <p>
        Lord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser
        heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,
        old-fashioned manner he departed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a
        level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that I
        shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this
        cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our
        client came into the room.”
      </p>
      <p>“My dear Holmes!”</p>
      <p>
        “I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked
        before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn
        my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally
        very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote
        Thoreau’s example.”
      </p>
      <p>“But I have heard all that you have heard.”</p>
      <p>
        “Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me
        so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and
        something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the
        Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is
        Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon
        the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which
        gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas
        bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the
        cigar which had been offered to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look
        dissatisfied.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I
        can make neither head nor tail of the business.”
      </p>
      <p>“Really! You surprise me.”</p>
      <p>
        “Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through
        my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand
        upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
      </p>
      <p>“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”</p>
      <p>“In heaven’s name, what for?”</p>
      <p>“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”</p>
      <p>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</p>
      <p>
        “Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.
      </p>
      <p>“Why? What do you mean?”</p>
      <p>
        “Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one
        as in the other.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all
        about it,” he snarled.
      </p>
      <p>“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”</p>
      <p>
        “Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the
        matter?”
      </p>
      <p>“I think it very unlikely.”</p>
      <p>
        “Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in
        it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a
        wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s
        wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he,
        putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is a little
        nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You
        dragged them from the Serpentine?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They
        have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the
        clothes were there the body would not be far off.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in the
        neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at
        through this?”
      </p>
      <p>“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”</p>
      <p>“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”</p>
      <p>
        “Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness. “I am
        afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and
        your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This
        dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”
      </p>
      <p>“And how?”</p>
      <p>
        “In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
        card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon
        the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is
        ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been that
        Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with
        confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here,
        signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly
        slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
        reach.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine
        indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his
        attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of
        satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.
      </p>
      <p>“Ha! you find it so?”</p>
      <p>“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”</p>
      <p>
        Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he
        shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”
      </p>
      <p>“On the contrary, this is the right side.”</p>
      <p>
        “The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over
        here.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which
        interests me deeply.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “ ‘Oct.
        4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass
        sherry, 8d.’ I see nothing in that.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it
        is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you
        again.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard
        work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,
        Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter
        first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made
        for the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival
        vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.
        Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such
        person.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his
        forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his
        overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor
        work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your
        papers for a little.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no
        time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man
        with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth
        whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great
        astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out
        upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of
        cold woodcock, a pheasant, a <em>pâté de foie gras</em> pie with a group
        of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my
        two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with
        no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered
        to this address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.
        His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which
        made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.</p>
      <p>“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”</p>
      <p>
        “Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am
        surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that
        I hear his step now upon the stairs.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
        dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
        perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
      </p>
      <p>“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.</p>
      <p>
        “Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have
        you good authority for what you say?”
      </p>
      <p>“The best possible.”</p>
      <p>
        Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the
        family has been subjected to such humiliation?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
        humiliation.”
      </p>
      <p>“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”</p>
      <p>
        “I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady
        could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was
        undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise
        her at such a crisis.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping
        his fingers upon the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented
        a position.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been
        shamefully used.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on the
        landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter,
        Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more
        successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
        “Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.
        Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and
        stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the
        breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had
        taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he
        still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,
        perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to
        be.”
      </p>
      <p>“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.</p>
      <p>
        “Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have
        spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the
        time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or
        saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there
        before the altar.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the
        room while you explain this matter?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had
        just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,
        I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a
        small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert
        manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I
        met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a
        claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day
        father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a
        claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the
        poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting
        any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his
        hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing
        anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
        fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his
        pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.
        So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself
        not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married
        right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I
        won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked it
        over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready
        in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to
        seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went
        prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After
        that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been
        attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the
        killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa
        thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not
        a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that
        Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came
        to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I
        felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in
        my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

        “Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty
        by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the
        altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it
        was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to
        the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me
        out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I
        looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
        if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t
        drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the
        clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn’t know what
        to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I
        glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he
        raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him
        scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note.
        As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and
        he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was
        only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
        Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to
        him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
      </p>

        “When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and
        had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a
        few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to
        Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those
        great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards.
        I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the
        window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began
        walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed
        him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
        me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of
        his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon
        overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some
        lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding
        after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the
        Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up
        for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon
        me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the
        church but not where the lady lived.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for
        openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like
        to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to
        Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think
        of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and
        waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things
        and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped
        them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
        should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman,
        Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is
        more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I
        was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting
        ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us
        a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away
        round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am
        very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think
        very meanly of me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had
        listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long
        narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most
        intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”
      </p>
      <p>“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”</p>
      <p>
        “Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand
        and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a
        friendly supper.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship.
        “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can
        hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your
        permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us
        all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said
        Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,
        for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the
        blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children
        from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag
        which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and
        Stripes.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our
        visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple
        the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be
        almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of
        events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result
        when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”
      </p>
      <p>“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”</p>
      <p>
        “From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the
        lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other
        that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.
        Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her
        to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have
        spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of
        the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be
        someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this
        country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an
        influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
        her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process
        of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who
        could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over
        her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood
        had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So
        far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he
        told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so
        transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet,
        of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant
        allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking
        possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole
        situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the
        man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in
        favour of the latter.”
      </p>
      <p>“And how in the world did you find them?”</p>
      <p>
        “It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in
        his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were,
        of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to
        know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most
        select London hotels.”
      </p>
      <p>“How did you deduce the select?”</p>
      <p>
        “By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a
        glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are
        not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I
        visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book
        that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day
        before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the
        very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to
        be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being
        fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give
        them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
        better in every way that they should make their position a little
        clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.
        I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the
        appointment.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly
        not very gracious.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very
        gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you
        found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think
        that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars
        that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw
        your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still
        to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”
